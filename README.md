# Cowin_
this is the small script developed by me using public api provided by the cowin itself and by running this script you will get the available slots details based on the pincode you provide and it will display and play the sound ding if any center is available based on the pin code and the current date.

how to run this file :
python will 3.0+ version will be fine..
playsound library need to be installed.
then download the whole as zip extract it and rewrite the sound effect file path base on the local location in the your systen

then open cmd navigate to your location and then just type python cowin.py

Cheers :)
